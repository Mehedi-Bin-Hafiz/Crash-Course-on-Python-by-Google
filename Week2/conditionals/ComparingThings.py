"""In Python, we can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a boolean result, or simply a True or False. 

To check if two values are the same, we can use the equality operator: == 
To check if two values are not the same, we can use the not equals operator: != 
We can also check if values are greater than or lesser than each other using > and <. If you try to compare data types that arenâ€™t compatible, like checking if a string is greater than an integer, Python will throw a TypeError. """
